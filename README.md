## ATLab (ARSIM Telemetry Lab)

ATLab is a real-time telemetry and timing dashboard inspired by professional Formula 1 timing panels.

It allows you to visualize:

- Driver and constructor standings
- Live lap times, gaps and mini sectors
- Real-time race and qualifying positions
- Weather and track conditions
- Historical championship data

The ATLab "logo" is simply a styled text element within the application interface, with "AT" in white and "Lab" in blue.
